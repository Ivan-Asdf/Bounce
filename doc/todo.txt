Bugfix/Refactoring/Porting:
- Make all C headers into the C++ "C" headers. Example <stdlib.h> ---> <cstdlib>
- Add support in CMakeLists for release build(the copying of files next built executable only happens in Debug build currently)
- Add forward declarition in headers instead of includes
- Do memory delete/cleanups start using smart pointers
- Make PlayerBall movement float correct, add Circle to PlayerBall
- See pros/cons of iterators vs for vs for-range loops and change code accordingly
- Add fancy logging macros/functions
- Add more pointer/error handling
- Add singleton folder in core put texture_loader and event_dispatcher there
- Make Collision engine move ball just above floor on collison
- Make googletest a submodule if there is benefit to it

Features:
- Add custom cursor and/or ui indicator for current mode.
- Add PlayerBall moving left/right logic.

Learning & documentation:
- Add documentation about how to use CMake with VsCode
- Learn how to debug in VsCode
- Learn in detail what is happening with tests.
